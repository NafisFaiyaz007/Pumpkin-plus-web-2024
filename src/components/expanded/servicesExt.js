              Emergency response for humanitarian causes, including catastrophic
              flooding and cold waves, is a core part of our cross-cutting
              activities. We collaborate with private sectors, NGOs, and family
              contributions to address these crises. Since 2021, we've
              successfully distributed 400 blankets with Shahjalal Bankâ€™s
              support in Gangadhara and Kaunia, Rangpur. In 2022 and 2023, 365
              blankets were provided at Pumpkin Plus HQ in Dinajpur through
              family funding. In 2024, we distributed pumpkin seeds to over 350
              farmers, mostly women, in Rangpur and Kurigram. We welcome small
              donations to support emergency responses and humanitarian causes.
              Please join us in making a difference.
